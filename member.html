                -Thomas Jefferson: The big cheese who loves the land of cheese! With a concern for individual liberty
                and a contempt for tyranny

                -Patrick Henry: Patrick Henry was one of the Founding Fathers of the United States and the first
                governor of Virginia.
                His famous speech “Give me liberty, or give me death!” roused people up to fight the British.

                -Samuel Adams:Founding father of the Sons of Liberty and Committees of Correspondence.
                He was also the cousin of John Adams, who was the second president of the United States; but the two
                had conflicting beliefs.
                When he’s not brewing, he’s spilling tea!
                An important rallyer for the patriot cause, he preaches freedom for all, from the elites to the working
                citizens in Boston.

                -Richard Henry Lee: He’s loud, proud, and draws in a crowd!
                His resolutions for government were a call to the Second Constitutional Convention, helping establish
                independence from the British.
                However, freedom from one oppressor was not good enough, for other tyrants could roll through and make
                the whole liberty go bust.
                He was the sixth President of Congress after the Revolutionary War, helping to draft the Articles of
                Confederation to guarantee individual rights
