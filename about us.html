                        Started in 1789 as the Anti-Administration Party, the Democratic-Republican Party was made to ensure liberty for all American peoples. 
                        We favored states’ rights and a strict interpretation of the Constitution.
                        Our power was peaked by Thomas Jefferson’s election in 1800, but there is still plenty more for us to do!
                        We abide by the Constitution strictly-- no getting loosey-goosey in our interpretation of the law!
